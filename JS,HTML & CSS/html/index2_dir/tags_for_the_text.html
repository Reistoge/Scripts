    <h1>Sumary of the semantic markup language in html:</h1>
    <p>the semantic markup provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a  
        sentence, that something you have written is a quotation(and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on. <br>
        i will writte and put examples of the tags that i  consider important, because i think that some of them dont 
        actually make a big deal learning or using, besides if you want to write them later please <br> try learning the other things first on the course.

    </p>
    <p>the use of the semantic markup is on the text that you write, so you just have to put this tags into the text you write (p tag, h1, h2, h3 tag or whatever text tag you).</p>
    <br>
    <h2>BOLD & ITALIC</h2>
     <section >
        <p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>
        <p><i>This is a paragraph tag with the "i" tag inside them. </i></p> <!-- all text written inside the "i" tag  put the text in italic-->
        <p><b>This is a paragraph tag with the "b" tag inside them. </b></p> <!-- all text written inside the "b" tag  put the text in bold-->
     </section>
    <br>
     <h2>SUPERSCRIPT AND SUBSCRIPT</h2>

     <section>
        <p>5 <sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>3</sup> = 31</p> <!-- all the text inside the sup tag will be like raising the characters or the text written inside the sup tag this are the text used for mathematical elevations or raising numbers etc. -->
        <p> 2 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O + 2 CO<sub>2</sub> &#8594; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> </p> <!-- in this case if i write a text inside the sub tag all the text appears below and a little smaller, this are the characters to type chemical formulas/solutions. -->

    <h2>WHITE SPACE COLLAPSING, "hr" & "br" TAG</h2>
    <section>
        <br>
        <p>When the browser come across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space, similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats thats as a single space too, this is called white space collapsing. <br>
             Yes, the "hr" tag and "br" are semantic markups, and also are empty elements or empty tags, this means that they dont use or have the closing tag</p>
        
        <br>         
        <h2>THE "abbr", "ins", "del" & "s" TAGS</h2>
        
        <h3>"abbr tag"</h3>
        <p> The <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> do some crazy space stuff. </p><!-- inside the atributte tittle you have tu put the definition of the word or characters that you want to abbreviate, the characters that are abbreviated goes between tags  -->
        <p> If you place the pointer near the words underlined by the abbr tag, it will show a smaller box explaining everything you put in the attribute "tittle". </p>
        <br>
        <h3>"ins tag"</h3>
        <p>this element the text, useful for remarking, underlining important or relevant words or characters. <br>this tags simply puts the text in underline</p>
        <p>Example:<br>this is the <ins>seventh</ins> time you are late. </p>    
        <br>
        <h3>" del or s tag "</h3>
        <p>this elements strikes out the text with a line  </p>
        <p>I dont see the differences between s and del it actually do the same action with the text.</p>
        <p>Example:<br>it was the <del>worst</del> best idea she had ever had (del tag).</p>
        <p>Example:<br>it was the <s>worst</s> best idea she had ever had (s tag).</p>
