    <h2>A new development in the controversy surrounding Mundfish</h2>
    <p>Mick Gordon, the composer for Mundfish's upcoming FPS, Atomic Heart,
    has announced that he will be donating the fees her received for 
    scoring the game to the Austrailian Red Cross Ukraine Crisis Appeal 
    for use in their humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.</p>

        <p >My musical contribution to #AtomicHeart will also support a greater cause. I've donated my fee to @RedCrossAU's Ukraine Crisis Appeal to 
            stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.If you're able to, please consider donating.Together we can make a difference.<abbr title="this is a p with the position:relative; property and moved it wsith the left property"><img class='abbr' src="../img/interrogation.png" ></abbr><br> #SupportUkraine.

    <p>The announcement is significant as it comes following the concern that developer Mundfish is allegedly
    supported by investors with hands in Russia's war in Ukraine; or that funds from Atomic Heart's sales
    may directly help the Russian government. While Mundfish is based in Cyprus, there have been allegations
    that it's mainly headquartered in Moscow.</p>

            The Deep End Games and 2124 Publishing has announced that Romancelvania, their unholy cross-breed of Metroidvania and dating sim, 
            will be hitting the bedsheets March 7, 2023.Romancelvania introduces us to a Dracula whose confidence is still laid up after a savage
             beating at the hands of the Van Helsing clan. Their lover left them, their minions don't respect them, and evil just doesn't have the 
             same appeal anymore. Death gets fed up with this pity party and sets Dracula up with their own dating show. It's time to choose from 12 
             “lucky” singles and help the dark lord (or lady) get their mojo back. Peer pressure is the proven way to turn a spark into a flame.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the studio allegedly has investors that have relations with Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom. While nothing has been directly proven, a lot of allegations have been brought up, and Mundfish hasn't
            exactly stepped in to set the record straight itself, stating that it simply does “not comment on politics.”
            
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>While Mick Gordon has not specifically commented on these accusations, this move is at least one that may help offset some of the concerns. However, it's not the same as if Mundfish itself donated proceeds to aid Ukraine.
    I would encourage you to do your own research into Mundfish's connection with the war in Ukraine, reach your own conclusions, and decide for yourself if purchasing Atomic Heart is reasonably moral for you.</p>
    <p>Mick Gordon has scored titles such as Wolfenstein: The New Order, Killer Instinct, and Doom Eternal. Atomic Heart is available February 21 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.</p>
